# Braver-Cat

Final project of the **Computer Vision** exam, taught by Prof. **Marco Raoul Marini** and Prof. **Luigi Cinque** at **Sapienza University of Rome** in A.Y. 2022/23

A set of **experiments** inspired by the ["Brain Tumor Segmentation with Deep Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03540.pdf) paper, which introduced lots of **novelties** at the time of its publication.

The project includes **multiple**, **custom-made** Deep Neural Networks for end-to-end and Transfer Learning tumor segmentation tasks.

Brain tumor segmentation Neural Networks follow the recepies published in the paper, whilst we explored some of our own ideas for liver tumor segmentation.
